#### This is a small script for Arch-compatible distros that runs simple benchmarks and stress tests.

* perf sched & mem
* stress-ng cpu & mem
* xz compression
* ffmpeg compilation
* y-cruncher pi calculation
* argon2 hashing
* blender rendering
* primesieve
* kernel defconfig
* namd
* x265 encoding


The scraper makes it possible to visulize the benchmarks.

# ToDo

- Geekbench: Request in benchmark, if its wanted to run geekbench and then print the URL into Logfile
- schbench: Add schbench and parse the result into logfile for scheduler latency benchmarking
